This is not a real life app ;-)

This is a boilerplate of mixing wuy/vbuild to be able to make GUI app with vuejs rendering (with vue/sfc components), thanks to [vbuild](https://github.com/manatlan/vbuild)

Before everything, make sure you have done :

```
pip3 install wuy vbuild
```

and start the `app.py`

Of course; you can freeze (with [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)) the app, and embbed the ``web`` folders : and you've got an simple standalone GUI executable (powered by [wuy](https://github.com/manatlan/wuy) and [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/)). With some css styles ; yours users won't see any difference.
